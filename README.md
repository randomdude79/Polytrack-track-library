# PolyLIB
## Overview:
This is a library of Polytrack tracks collected from many spots, including the official tracks.  
  
Every month, two of my friends ([ʟɨʄʟ] DaMidYeti and [ʟɨʄʟ] dameemeer7), and I ([ʟɨʄʟ] randomdude_79) will try all of the tracks posted every month on the official track sharing page on [itch.io](https://itch.io) and publish the most creative, funny, and overall well-made track on our project homepage, in addition to adding this track to our "Tracks of the month" collection.  
  
Follow me on itch.io: [@randomdude_79](https://randomdude-79.itch.io)

## Rules on credit:
1. All tracks made by others will be either in a folder named "Username"'s collection, or if it is only one track, then it is named: "Track Name" - "Username".
2. All tracks will be renamed in-game to "Username"'s "Track name"
